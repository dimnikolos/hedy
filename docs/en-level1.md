# A story

At Level 1, as an example, you can create a story with a different main character that you enter yourself.

### Example
This is my story, on the dots the main character that you choose will be placed later.

* The main character of this story is ...
* He walks in the forest
* He is a little scared ...
* He hears crazy sounds everywhere
* He is afraid this is a ghost forest

### Assignment

Now you can try yourself.

1. Write a story of a few sentences about your main character.
2. Where the name of your main character should be placed, just put ... (see example)
3. There may also be sentences in the story that do not contain a main character
4. Now translate your story into Hedy code, here's how:

Line 1: type "ask what is the main character of your story"

For all of the following lines:

* If there are dots in the line, type `echo` followed by your sentence
* If there are no dots in the line, type `print` followed by your sentence

### Example Hedy code

* `ask The main character of this story is ...`
* `print The main character of this story is ...`
* `print He walks in the forest`
* `acho He is a little scared ...`
* `print He hears crazy sounds everywhere`
* `print He is afraid this is a ghost forest`


### A simple story
It is a bit of a pity that you can now only create sentences in which the main character is at the end of the sentence right?
Then, after practicing this story, proceed to level 2 and then level 3, where you can create more and more complicated programs.
